In previous placement processes, Roima Intelligence has typically included coding questions that assess candidates' understanding of various data structures, algorithms, and general programming concepts. Some common types of questions include:

Data Structures:

Implementing a binary search tree and inserting elements.
Deleting a node in a linked list.
Detecting cycles in a linked list.
Arrays:

Performing operations like left rotations on an array.
Finding the largest and smallest elements in an unsorted array.
Determining if two arrays are equal.
Strings:

Converting time formats, such as from 12-hour AM/PM format to 24-hour format.
Conceptual Questions:

Explaining basic data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees).
Understanding sorting and searching algorithms.
These types of questions are designed to test both practical coding skills and theoretical knowledge. It's advisable to practice a variety of problems, especially those involving common data structures and algorithms, to prepare effectively for their written test.

For detailed practice, platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and GeeksforGeeks offer extensive resources and problem sets that align well with the kinds of questions you might encounter​ (HackerRank)​​ (Forage)​.

Good luck with your preparation! If you need help with specific types of problems, feel free to ask.
